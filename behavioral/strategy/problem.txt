1. Definition
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms (strategies), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable at runtime without changing the client code.
👉 In short: It separates the behavior (algorithm) from the context (object using it).

2. Key Concepts
	• Context → The main class that uses a strategy.
	• Strategy Interface → Common interface for all algorithms.
	• Concrete Strategies → Implementations of the algorithm.

3. Real-World Examples
	• Payment methods in e-commerce (Credit Card, PayPal, UPI).
	• Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort).
	• Compression strategies (ZIP, RAR, 7z).
	• Travel routes (Car, Bike, Train, Flight).



5. Advantages
✅ Avoids if-else or switch hell.
✅ Easily extendable (just add new strategies).
✅ Promotes Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).
✅ Behavior change at runtime.

6. Disadvantages
❌ More classes → more complexity.
❌ Client must know which strategy to use.

7. When to Use
	• When you have multiple algorithms that can be swapped at runtime.
	• When you see too many conditionals (if/else) for selecting behavior.
	• When you want to isolate algorithm implementation from the main class.
